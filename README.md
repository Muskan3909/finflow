## Design Decisions & Trade-offs

### State Management: Context + useReducer
Chose React's built-in Context API with `useReducer` over Redux or Zustand. For a dashboard of this scale, a single reducer with typed actions (`ADD_TRANSACTION`, `EDIT_TRANSACTION`, etc.) is clear, testable, and requires zero extra dependencies. The trade-off is that Context isn't optimised for high-frequency updates — a dedicated state library would be preferable if real-time data streams were involved.

### Styling: CSS Variables, No Framework
Plain CSS with custom properties gives full design control without Tailwind's class verbosity or MUI's bundle overhead. The design tokens (colours, spacing, typography) live in `:root` and a `.light` override class, making dark/light mode a single `className` swap on `<html>`.

### Charts: Recharts
Recharts integrates naturally with React's declarative model. Custom tooltip components keep the visual language consistent with the rest of the UI. The trade-off versus a canvas-based library (e.g. Chart.js) is slightly larger bundle size, offset by better React compatibility.

### Role-based UI: Frontend-only
Viewer/Admin is toggled in the header and stored in `localStorage`. Viewer sees data only; Admin sees Add/Edit/Delete controls on the transactions table. This is a UI simulation — real RBAC would require backend enforcement.

### Data Persistence: localStorage
Transactions, role, and theme are serialised to `localStorage` on every state change via a `useEffect`. This gives session persistence without a backend. Trade-off: storage is limited to ~5 MB and is not shared across devices.

## Mock Data

36 transactions across **January – March 2026** covering 9 categories:

`Salary · Freelance · Rent · Food · Transport · Utilities · Shopping · Health · Entertainment`

All amounts are in Indian Rupees (₹), simulating a Bengaluru-based professional's monthly finances.
